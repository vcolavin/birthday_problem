# The Birthday Problem
## AKA [the birthday paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem)

[Demo here.](http://vcolavin.com/birthday_problem)

In short, it takes a surprisingly small group of people for it to be likely that two people will share a birthday.

I got the math from this [Wolfram MathWorld post](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BirthdayProblem.html).

Except for [math.js](http://mathjs.org/) (used to prevent the answer from almost always being "Infinity" or "NaN"), this is [vanilla JavaScript](http://vanilla-js.com/).
